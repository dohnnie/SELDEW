# Overview
This is a demo of the webapp component to the SELDEW project for HackWesTx.
We couldn't get the arduino to communicate with the database so we're unable to connect the different parts of the project together.
This demo is meant to demonstrate what the webapp would do in a completed project so all the values, and graphs are hardcoded in.
It was developed using expo.io and `react-native`
Meant to be used in conjunction with [HackathonWaterTracker](https://github.com/wumboingwumbos/HackathonWaterTracker)

# Purpose
The webapp is given the graphs from the `GraphMaker.py` after getting data from the mongoDB database.
The webapp is supposed to be able to pull data values from the database to display any data values in text, and then display a visualization of the data
